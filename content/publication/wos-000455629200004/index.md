abstract: Abiotic stresses are considered the most deleterious factor affecting growth
  and development of plants worldwide. Such stresses are largely unavoidable and trigger
  adaptive responses affecting different cellular processes and target different compartments.
  Shotgun proteomic and mass spectrometry-based approaches offer an opportunity to
  elucidate the response of the proteome to abiotic stresses. In this study, the severe
  drought or water-deficit response in Arabidopsis thaliana was mimicked by treating
  cell suspension callus with 40% polyethylene glycol for 10 and 30 min. Resulting
  data demonstrated that 310 proteins were differentially expressed in response to
  this treatment with a strict +/- 2.0-fold change. Over-representation was observed
  in the gene ontology categories of ribosome' and its related functions as well as
  oxidative phosphorylation', indicating both structural and functional drought responses
  at the cellular level. Proteins in the category endocytosis' also show significant
  enrichment and this is consistent with increased active transport and recycling
  of membrane proteins in response to abiotic stress. This is supported by the particularly
  pronounced enrichment in proteins of the endosomal sorting complexes that are required
  for membrane remodelling. Taken together, the findings point to rapid and complex
  physiological and structural changes essential for survival in response to sudden
  severe drought stress.
