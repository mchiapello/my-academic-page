abstract: During establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, fungal hyphae
  invade root cells producing transient tree-like structures, the arbuscules, where
  exchange of photosynthates for soil minerals occurs. Arbuscule formation and collapse
  lead to rapid production and degradation of plant and fungal membranes, their spatiotemporal
  dynamics directly influencing nutrient exchange. We determined the ultra-structural
  details of both membrane surfaces and the interstitial apoplastic matrix by transmission
  electron microscopy tomography during growth and senescence of Rhizophagus irregularis
  arbuscules in rice. Invasive growth of arbuscular hyphae was associated with abundant
  fungal membrane tubules (memtubs) and plant peri-arbuscular membrane evaginations.
  Similarly, the phylogenetically distant arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Gigaspora
  rosea, and the fungal maize pathogen, Ustilago maydis, developed memtubs while invading
  host cells, revealing structural commonalities independent of the mutualistic or
  parasitic outcome of the interaction. Additionally, extracellular vesicles formed
  continuously in the peri-arbuscular interface from arbuscule biogenesis to senescence,
  suggesting an involvement in inter-organismic signal and nutrient exchange throughout
  the arbuscule lifespan.
