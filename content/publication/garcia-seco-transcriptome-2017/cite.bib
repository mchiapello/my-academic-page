 abstract = {The molecular details of local plant response against Xanthomonas translucens infection is largely unknown. Moreover, there is no knowledge about effects of the pathogen on the root's transcriptome and proteome. Therefore, we investigated the global gene and protein expression changes both in leaves and roots of wheat  (Triticum aestivum) 24 h post leaf infection of X. translucens. This simultaneous analysis allowed us to obtain insight into possible metabolic rearrangements in above- and belowground tissues and to identify common responses as well as specific alterations. At the site of infection, we observed the implication of various components of the recognition, signaling, and amplification mechanisms in plant response to the pathogen. Moreover, data indicate a massive down-regulation of photosynthesis and confirm the chloroplast as crucial signaling hub during pathogen attack. Notably, roots responded as well to foliar attack and their response significantly differed from that locally triggered in infected leaves. Data indicate that roots as a site of energy production and synthesis of various  secondary metabolites may actively influence the composition and colonisation level of root-associated microbes. Finally, our results emphasize the accumulation of jasmonic acid, pipecolic acid and/or the downstream mediator of hydrogen peroxide as long distal signals from infected leaves to roots.},
