abstract: In terrestrial ecosystems most plant species live in mutualistic symbioses
  with nutrient-delivering arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Establishment of AM
  symbioses includes transient, intracellular formation of fungal feeding structures,
  the arbuscules. A plant-derived peri-arbuscular membrane (PAM) surrounds the arbuscules,
  mediating reciprocal nutrient exchange. Signaling at the PAM must be well coordinated
  to achieve this dynamic cellular intimacy. Here, we identify the PAM-specific Arbuscular
  Receptor-like Kinase 1 (ARK1) from maize and rice to condition sustained AM symbiosis.
  Mutation of rice ARK1 causes a significant reduction in vesicles, the fungal storage
  structures, and a concomitant reduction in overall root colonization by the AM fungus
  Rhizophagus irregularis. Arbuscules, although less frequent in the ark1 mutant,
  are morphologically normal. Co-cultivation with wild-type plants restores vesicle
  and spore formation, suggesting ARK1 function is required for the completion of
  the fungal life-cycle, thereby defining a functional stage, post arbuscule development.
