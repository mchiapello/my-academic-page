abstract: Camellia japonica plants manifesting a complex and variable spectrum of
  viral symptoms like chlorotic ringspots, necrotic rings, yellowing with necrotic
  rings, yellow mottle, leaves and petals deformations, and flower colorbreaking have
  been studied since 1940, mainly by electron microscopic analyses; however, a strong
  correlation between the symptoms and one or more well-characterized viruses was
  never verified. In this work, samples collected from symptomatic plants were analyzed
  using the next-generation sequencing technique, and a complex virome composed of
  members of the Betaflexiviridae and Fimoviridae families was identified. In particular,
  the genomic fragments typical of the emaravirus group were organized in the genomes
  of two new emaraviruses species, tentatively named Camellia japonica-associated
  emaravirus 1 and 2. They are the first emaraviruses described in camellia plants
  and found in symptomatic plants. At the same time, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
  plants, five betaflexivirus isolates were detected that, based on amino acid sequence
  comparisons, can be considered two new isolates of the recently characterized camellia
  ringspot-associated virus 1 and 2 (CRSaV-1/2). These recently identified betaflexiviruses
  associated with C. japonica disease show an unusual hyper-conservation of the coat
  protein at the amino acid level.
