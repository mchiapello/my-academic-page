abstract: Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) between plants and soil fungi are widespread
  symbioses with a major role in soil nutrient uptake. In this study we investigated
  the induction of root cortical cell division during AM colonization by combining
  morphometric and gene expression analyses with promoter activation and protein localization
  studies of the cell-plate-associated exocytic marker TPLATE. Our results show that
  TPLATE promoter is activated in colonized cells of the root cortex where we also
  observed the appearance of cells that are half the size of the surrounding cells.
  Furthermore, TPLATE-green fluorescent protein recruitment to developing cell plates
  highlighted ectopic cell division events in the inner root cortex during early AM
  colonization. Lastly, transcripts of TPLATE, KNOLLE and Cyclinlike 1 (CYC1) are
  all upregulated in the same context, alongside endocytic markers Adaptor-Related
  Protein complex 2 alpha 1 subunit (AP2A1) and Clathrin Heavy Chain 2 (CHC2), known
  to be active during cell plate formation. This pattern of gene expression was recorded
  in wild-type Medicago truncatula roots, but not in a common symbiotic signalling
  pathway mutant where fungal colonization is blocked at the epidermal level. Altogether,
  these results suggest the activation of cell-division-related mechanisms by AM hosts
  during the accommodation of the symbiotic fungus.
