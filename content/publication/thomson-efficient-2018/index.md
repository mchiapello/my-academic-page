abstract: 'The authors show that quiescent (Q-Cell) Escherichia coli cultures can
  maintain metabolic activity in the absence of growth for up to 24 h, leading to
  four times greater specific productivity of a model metabolite, 3-hydroxybutyrate
  (3HB), than a control. Q-cells can be created by using the proton ionophore indole
  to halt cell division of an hns mutant strain. This uncouples metabolism from cell
  growth and allows for more efficient use of carbon feedstocks because less metabolic
  effort is diverted to surplus biomass production. However, the reason for the increased
  productivity of cells in the quiescent state was previously unknown. In this study,
  proteome expression patterns between wild-type and Q-cell cultures show that Q-cells
  overexpress stress response proteins, which prime them to tolerate the metabolic
  imbalances incurred through indole addition. Metabolomic data reveal the accumulation
  of acetyl-coenzyme A and phosphoenolpyruvate: excellent starting points for high-value
  chemical production. We demonstrate the exploitation of these accumulated metabolites
  by engineering a simple pathway for 3HB production from acetyl-coenzyme A. Quiescent
  cultures produced half the cell biomass of control cultures lacking indole, but
  were still able to produce 39.4 g L(-1) of 3HB compared to 18.6 g L(-1) in the control.
  Q-cells therefore have great potential as a platform technology for the  efficient
  production of a wide range of commodity and high value chemicals.'
