abstract: P>The aim of this paper was to understand whether the endobacterium identified
  as Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum has an effect on the biology of its host,
  the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita, through the study of the
  modifications induced on the fungal proteome and lipid profile. The availability
  of G. margarita cured spores (i.e. spores that do not contain bacteria), represented
  a crucial tool to enable the comparison between two fungal homogeneous populations
  in the presence and the absence of the bacterial components. Our results demonstrate
  that the endobacterial presence leads to a modulation of fungal protein expression
  in all the different conditions we tested (quiescent, germinating and strigolactone-elicited
  germinating spores), and in particular after treatment with a strigolactone analogue.
  The fungal fatty acid profile resulted to be modified both quantitatively and qualitatively
  in the absence of endobacteria, being fatty acids less abundant in the cured spores.
  The results offer one of the first comparative metabolic studies of an AM fungus
  investigated under different physiological conditions, reveal that endobacteria
  have an important impact on the host fungal activity, influencing both protein expression
  and lipid profile, and suggest that the bacterial absence is perceived by G. margarita
  as a stimulus which activates stress-responsive proteins.
