abstract: 'Introduction: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis between soil fungi
  and the majority of plants is based on a mutualistic exchange of organic and inorganic
  nutrients. This takes place inside root cortical cells that harbor an arbuscule:
  a highly branched intracellular fungal hypha enveloped by an extension of the host
  cell membrane-the perifungal membrane-which outlines a specialized symbiotic interface
  compartment. The perifungal membrane develops around each intracellular hypha as
  the symbiotic fungus proceeds across the root tissues; its biogenesis is the result
  of an extensive exocytic process and shows a few similarities with cell plate insertion
  which occurs at the end of somatic cytokinesis. Materials and Methods: We here analyzed
  the subcellular localization of a GFP fusion with TPLATE, a subunit of the endocytic
  TPLATE complex (TPC), a central actor in plant clathrin-mediated endocytosis with
  a role in cell plate anchoring with the parental plasma membrane. Results: Our observations
  demonstrate that Daucus carota and Medicago truncatula root organ cultures expressing
  a 35S::AtTPLATE-GFP construct accumulate strong fluorescent green signal at sites
  of symbiotic interface construction, along recently formed perifungal membranes
  and at sites of cell-to-cell hyphal passage between adjacent cortical cells, where
  the perifungal membrane fuses with the plasmalemma. Discussion: Our results strongly
  suggest that TPC-mediated endocytic processes are active during perifungal membrane
  interface biogenesis-alongside exocytic transport. This novel conclusion, which
  might be correlated to the accumulation of late endosomes in the vicinity of the
  developing interface, hints at the involvement of TPC-dependent membrane remodeling
  during the intracellular accommodation of AM fungi.'
