abstract: Bacterial kiwifruit vine disease (Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, Psa)
  and halo blight of bean (P. syringae pv. phaseolicola, Pph) are routinely treated
  with copper, leading to environmental pollution and bacterial copper resistance.
  An alternative sustainable control method could be based on bacteriophages, as phage
  biocontrol offers high specificity and does not result in the spread of toxic residues
  into the environment or the food chain. In this research, specific phages suitable
  for phage-based biocontrol strategies effective against Psa and Pph were isolated
  and characterized. In total, sixteen lytic Pph phage isolates and seven lytic Psa
  phage isolates were isolated from soil in Piedmont and Veneto in northern Italy.
  Genome characterization of fifteen selected phages revealed that the isolated Pph
  phages were highly similar and could be considered as isolates of a novel species,
  whereas the isolated Psa phages grouped into four distinct clades, two of which
  represent putative novel species. No lysogeny-, virulence- or toxin-related genes
  were found in four phages, making them suitable for potential biocontrol purposes.
  A partial biological characterization including a host range analysis was performed
  on a representative subset of these isolates. This analysis was a prerequisite to
  assess their efficacy in greenhouse and in field trials, using different delivery
  strategies.</p>
