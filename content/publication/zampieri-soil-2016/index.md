abstract: For some truffle species of the Tuber genus, the symbiotic phase is often
  associated with the presence of an area of scant vegetation, commonly known as the
  brule, around the host tree. Previous metagenomics studies have identified the microorganisms
  present inside and outside the brule of a Tuber melanosporum truffle-ground, but
  the molecular mechanisms that operate in this ecological niche remain to be clarified.
  To elucidate the metabolic pathways present in the  brule, we conducted a metaproteomics
  analysis on the soil of a characterized truffle-ground and cross-referenced the
  resulting proteins with a database we constructed, incorporating the metagenomics
  data for the organisms previously identified in this soil. The soil inside the brule
  contained a larger number of proteins and, surprisingly, more proteins from plants,
  compared with the soil outside the brule. In addition, Fisher's Exact Tests detected
  more biological processes inside the brule; these processes were related to responses
  to multiple types of stress. Thus, although the brule has a reduced diversity of
  plant and microbial species, the organisms in the brule show strong metabolic activity.
  Also, the combination of metagenomics and metaproteomics provides a powerful tool
  to reveal soil functioning.
