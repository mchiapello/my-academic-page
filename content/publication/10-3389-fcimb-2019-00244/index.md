abstract: Zoysia japonica, in Brazil, is commonly infected by Rhizoctonia solani (R.
  solani) in humid and cool weather conditions. Eight isolates of R. solani, previously
  identified as belonging to the AG2-2 LP anastomosis group, isolated from samples
  from large path symptoms, were collected from three counties in SÃ£o Paulo state
  (Brazil) and investigated for the presence of mycoviruses. After detection of double-strand
  RNA (dsRNA) in all samples, RNA_Seq analysis of ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA
  from in vitro cultivated mycelia was performed. Forty-seven partial or complete
  viral unique RNA dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences were obtained with a
  high prevalence of positive sense ssRNA viruses. Sequences were sufficiently different
  from the first match in BLAST searches suggesting that they all qualify as possible
  new viral species, except for one sequence showing an almost complete match with
  Rhizoctonia solani dsRNA virus 2, an alphapartitivirus. Surprisingly four large
  contigs of putative viral RNA could not be assigned to any existing clade of viruses
  present in the databases, but no DNA was detected corresponding to these fragments
  confirming their viral replicative nature. This is the first report on the occurrence
  of mycoviruses in R. solani AG2-2 LP in South America.
