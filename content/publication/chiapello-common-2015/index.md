abstract: Although adaptive metal tolerance may arise in fungal populations in polluted
  soils, the mechanisms underlying metal-specific tolerance are poorly understood.  Comparative
  proteomics is a powerful tool to identify variation in protein profiles caused by
  changing environmental conditions, and was used to investigate protein accumulation
  in a metal tolerant isolate of the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Oidiodendron maius
  exposed to zinc and cadmium. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and shotgun proteomics
  followed by mass spectrometry lead to the  identification of common and metal-specific
  proteins and pathways. Proteins selectively induced by cadmium exposure were molecular
  chaperons of the Hsp90 family, cytoskeletal proteins and components of the translation
  machinery. Zinc significantly up-regulated metabolic pathways related to energy
  production and carbohydrates metabolism, likely mirroring zinc adaptation of this
  fungal isolate. Common proteins induced by the two metal ions were the antioxidant
  enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and ubiquitin. In mycelia exposed to zinc and
  cadmium, both proteomic techniques also identified agmatinase, an enzyme involved
  in polyamine biosynthesis. This novel finding suggests that, like plants, polyamines
  may have important functions in response to abiotic environmental stress in fungi.
  Genetic evidence also suggests that the biosynthesis of polyamines via an alternative
  metabolic pathway may be widespread in fungi.
