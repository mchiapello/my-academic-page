abstract: Cellular mechanisms of asbestos toxicity rely, at least in part, on the
  chemical composition of these minerals. Iron ions are directly involved in the accepted
  mechanism of fiber toxicity because they constitute active centers where release
  of free radicals and reactive oxygen species takes place. Although no current technology
  is available for the remediation of asbestos polluted sites, the soil fungus Fusarium
  oxysporum was found to be very effective in iron extraction from crocidolite asbestos
  in vitro, and to cause a significant reduction in asbestos surface reactivity and
  oxidative damage to naked DNA. As little information is available on the molecular
  mechanisms of the fungus asbestos interactions, a combined proteomic approach that
  used 2-DE, shotgun and quantitative iTRAQ proteomics was used to investigate the
  fungal metabolic activities in the presence of crocidolite, an iron-rich type of
  asbestos. Although global proteomic analyses did not show significant changes in
  the protein expression pattern of F. oxysporum when exposed to asbestos fibers,
  some proteins specifically regulated by asbestos suggest up-regulation of metabolic
  pathways involved in protection from oxidative stress. When compared with the response
  to crocidolite observed by other authors in human lung epithelial cells, that unlike
  fungi can internalize the asbestos fibres, a significant difference was the regulation
  of the pentose phosphate pathway.
