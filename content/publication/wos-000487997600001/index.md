abstract: Data analysis and graphical representation form an essential part of scientific
  research dissemination. The life-science community is moving towards a more transparent
  presentation of single data points or data distributions and away from mean values
  displayed as bar charts. To facilitate transparent data display to the mycorrhiza
  community, we present ``Ramfâ€³ an open-source R package for statistical analysis
  and preparation of a variety of publication-ready plots, custom-made for analyzing
  and displaying quantitative root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi or
  any kind of data to be displayed in the same format. Ramf replaces the scripting
  needed for data analysis and can be readily used by researchers not acquainted with
  R. In addition, the package is open to improvements by the community. Ramf is available
  at https://github.com/mchiapello/Ramf.
