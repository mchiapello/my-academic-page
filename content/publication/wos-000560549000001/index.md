abstract: Decomposition of animal bodies in the burial environment plays a key role
  in the biochemistry of the soil, altering the balance of the local microbial populations
  present before the introduction of the carcass. Despite the growing number of studies
  on decomposition and soil bacterial populations, less is known on its effects on
  fungal communities. Shifts in the fungal populations at different post-mortem intervals
  (PMIs) could provide insights for PMI estimation and clarify the role that specific
  fungal taxa have at specific decomposition stages. In this study, we buried pig
  carcasses over a period of 1- to 6-months, and we sampled the soil in contact with
  each carcass at different PMIs. We performed metabarcoding analysis of the mycobiome
  targeting both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2, to elucidate which
  one was more suitable for this purpose. Our results showed a decrease in the fungal
  taxonomic richness associated with increasing PMIs, and the alteration of the soil
  fungal signature even after 6 months post-burial, showing the inability of soil
  communities to restore their original composition within this timeframe. The results
  highlighted taxonomic trends associated with specific PMIs, such as the increase
  of the Mortierellomycota after 4- and 6-months and of Ascomycota particularly after
  2 months, and the decrease of Basidiomycota from the first to the last time point.
  We have found a limited number of taxa specifically associated with the carrion
  and not present in the control soil, showing that the major contributors to the
  recorded changes are originated from the soil and were not introduced by the carrion.
  As this is the first study conducted on burial graves, it sets the baseline for
  additional studies to investigate the role of fungal communities on prolonged decomposition
  periods and to identify fungal biomarkers to improve the accuracy of PMI prediction
  for forensic applications.
