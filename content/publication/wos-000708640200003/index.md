abstract: "Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips [WFT]) and Thrips tabaci\
  \ (onion thrips [OT]) are insect species that greatly impact horticultural crops\
  \ through direct damage and their efficient vectoring of tomato spotted wilt virus\
  \ and iris yellow spot virus. In this study, we collected thrips of these species\
  \ from 12 field populations in various regions in Italy. We also included one field\
  \ population of Neohydatothrips variabilis (soybean thrips [ST]) from the United\
  \ States. Total RNA data from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) were used to assemble\
  \ the virome, and then we assigned putative viral contigs to each thrips sample\
  \ by real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRTPCR). Excluding plant\
  \ and fungal viruses, we were able to identify 61 viral segments, corresponding\
  \ to 41 viruses: 14 were assigned to WFT, 17 to OT, and 1 to ST; 9 viruses could\
  \ not be assigned to any species based on our stringent criteria. All these viruses\
  \ are putative representative of new species (with only the exception of a sobemo-like\
  \ virus that is 100% identical to a virus recently characterized in ST) and some\
  \ belong to new higher-ranking taxa. These additions to the viral phylogeny suggest\
  \ previously undescribed evolutionary niches. Most of Baltimore's classes of RNA\
  \ viruses were present (positive-and minus-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses),\
  \ but only one DNA virus was identified in our collection. Repeated sampling in\
  \ a subset of locations in 2019 and 2020 and further virus characterization in a\
  \ subset of four thrips populations maintained in the laboratory allowed us to provide\
  \ evidence of a locally persistent thrips core virome that characterizes each population.\
  \ IMPORTANCE Harnessing the insect microbiome can result in new approaches to contain\
  \ their populations or the damage they cause vectoring viruses of medical, veterinary,\
  \ or agricultural importance. Persistent insect viruses are a neglected component\
  \ of their microbiota. In this study, for the first time, we characterize the virome\
  \ associated with the two model systems for tospovirus-transmitting thrips species,\
  \ of utmost importance for the direct and indirect damage they cause to a number\
  \ of different crops. The thrips virome characterized includes several novel viruses,\
  \ which in some cases reveal previously undescribed clades. More importantly, some\
  \ of the viruses we describe are part of a core virome that is specific and consistently\
  \ present in distinct geographical locations monitored over the years, hinting at\
  \ a possible mutualistic symbiotic relationship with their host."
