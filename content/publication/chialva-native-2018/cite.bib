 abstract = {Several studies have investigated soil microbial biodiversity, but understanding  of the mechanisms underlying plant responses to soil microbiota remains in its infancy. Here, we focused on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), testing the hypothesis that plants grown on native soils display different responses to soil  microbiotas. Using transcriptomics, proteomics, and biochemistry, we describe the responses of two tomato genotypes (susceptible or resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) grown on an artificial growth substrate and two native soils  (conducive and suppressive to Fusarium). Native soils affected tomato responses by modulating pathways involved in responses to oxidative stress, phenol biosynthesis, lignin deposition, and innate immunity, particularly in the suppressive soil. In tomato plants grown on steam-disinfected soils, total phenols and lignin decreased significantly. The inoculation of a mycorrhizal fungus partly rescued this response locally and systemically. Plants inoculated with the fungal pathogen showed reduced disease symptoms in the resistant genotype in both soils, but the susceptible genotype was partially protected from the pathogen only when grown on the suppressive soil. The 'state of alert' detected in tomatoes reveals novel mechanisms operating in plants in native soils and the soil microbiota appears to be one of the drivers of these plant responses.},
