abstract: Besides improved mineral nutrition, plants colonised by arbuscular mycorrhizal
  (AM) fungi often display increased biomass and higher tolerance to biotic and abiotic
  stresses. Notwithstanding the global importance of wheat as an agricultural crop,
  its response to AM symbiosis has been poorly investigated. We  focused on the role
  of an AM fungus on mineral nutrition of wheat, and on its potential protective effect
  against Xanthomonas translucens. To address these issues, phenotypical, molecular
  and metabolomic approaches were combined. Morphological observations highlighted
  that AM wheat plants displayed an increased biomass and grain yield, as well as
  a reduction in lesion area following pathogen infection. To elucidate the molecular
  mechanisms underlying the mycorrhizal phenotype, we investigated changes of transcripts
  and proteins in roots and leaves during the double (wheat-AM fungus) and tripartite
  (wheat-AM fungus-pathogen) interaction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling identified
  the main pathways involved in enhancing plant biomass, mineral nutrition and in
  promoting the bio-protective effect against the leaf pathogen. Mineral and amino  acid
  contents in roots, leaves and seeds, and protein oxidation profiles in leaves, supported
  the omics data, providing new insight into the mechanisms exerted by AM symbiosis
  to confer stronger productivity and enhanced resistance to X. translucens in wheat.
