abstract: Mutualistic plant-associated fungi are recognized as important drivers in
  plant evolution, diversity, and health. The discovery that mycoviruses can take
  part and play important roles in symbiotic tripartite interactions has prompted
  us to study the viromes associated with a collection of ericoid and orchid mycorrhizal
  (ERM and ORM, respectively) fungi. Our study, based on high-throughput sequencing
  of transcriptomes (RNAseq) from fungal isolates grown in axenic cultures, revealed
  in both ERM and ORM fungi the presence of new mycoviruses closely related to already
  classified virus taxa, but also new viruses that expand the boundaries of characterized
  RNA virus diversity to previously undescribed evolutionary trajectories. In ERM
  fungi, we provide first evidence of a bipartite virus, distantly related to narnaviruses,
  that splits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) palm domain into two distinct
  proteins, encoded by each of the two segments. Furthermore, in one isolate of the
  ORM fungus Tulasnella spp. we detected a 12 kb genomic fragment coding for an RdRP
  with features of bunyavirus-like RdRPs. However, this 12 kb genomic RNA has the
  unique features, for Bunyavirales members, of being tricistronic and carrying ORFs
  for the putative RdRP and putative nucleocapsid in ambisense orientation on the
  same genomic RNA. Finally, a number of ORM fungal isolates harbored a group of ambisense
  bicistronic viruses with a genomic size of around 5 kb, where we could identify
  a putative RdRP palm domain that has some features of plus strand RNA viruses; these
  new viruses may represent a new lineage in the Riboviria, as they could not be reliably
  assigned to any of the branches in the recently derived monophyletic tree that includes
  most viruses with an RNA genome.
