abstract: Although adaptive metal tolerance may arise in fungal populations in polluted
  soils, the mechanisms underlying metal-specific tolerance are poorly understood.
  Comparative proteomics is a powerful tool to identify variation in protein profiles
  caused by changing environmental conditions, and was used to investigate protein
  accumulation in a metal tolerant isolate of the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Oidiodendron
  maius exposed to zinc and cadmium. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and shotgun
  proteomics followed by mass spectrometry lead to the identification of common and
  metal-specific proteins and pathways. Proteins selectively induced by cadmium exposure
  were molecular chaperons of the Hsp90 family, cytoskeletal proteins and components
  of the translation machinery. Zinc significantly up-regulated metabolic pathways
  related to energy production and carbohydrates metabolism, likely mirroring zinc
  adaptation of this fungal isolate. Common proteins induced by the two metal ions
  were the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and ubiquitin. In mycelia
  exposed to zinc and cadmium, both proteomic techniques also identified agmatinase,
  an enzyme involved in polyamine biosynthesis. This novel finding suggests that,
  like plants, polyamines may have important functions in response to abiotic environmental
  stress in fungi. Genetic evidence also suggests that the biosynthesis of polyamines
  via an alternative metabolic pathway may be widespread in fungi.
