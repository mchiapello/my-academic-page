abstract: The molecular details of local plant response against Xanthomonas translucens
  infection is largely unknown. Moreover, there is no knowledge about effects of the
  pathogen on the root's transcriptome and proteome. Therefore, we investigated the
  global gene and protein expression changes both in leaves and roots of wheat (Triticum
  aestivum) 24 h post leaf infection of X. translucens. This simultaneous analysis
  allowed us to obtain insight into possible metabolic rearrangements in above-and
  belowground tissues and to identify common responses as well as specific alterations.
  At the site of infection, we observed the implication of various components of the
  recognition, signaling, and amplification mechanisms in plant response to the pathogen.
  Moreover, data indicate a massive down-regulation of photosynthesis and confirm
  the chloroplast as crucial signaling hub during pathogen attack. Notably, roots
  responded as well to foliar attack and their response significantly differed from
  that locally triggered in infected leaves. Data indicate that roots as a site of
  energy production and synthesis of various secondary metabolites may actively influence
  the composition and colonisation level of root-associated microbes. Finally, our
  results emphasize the accumulation of jasmonic acid, pipecolic acid and/or the downstream
  mediator of hydrogen peroxide as long distal signals from infected leaves to roots.
