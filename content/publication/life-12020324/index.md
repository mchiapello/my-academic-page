abstract: The increasing dynamic functions of post-translational modifications (PTMs)
  within protein molecules present outstanding challenges for plant biology even at
  this present day. Protein PTMs are among the first and fastest plant responses to
  changes in the environment, indicating that the mechanisms and dynamics of PTMs
  are an essential area of plant biology. Besides being key players in signaling,
  PTMs play vital roles in gene expression, gene, and protein localization, protein
  stability and interactions, as well as enzyme kinetics. In this review, we take
  a broader but concise approach to capture the current state of events in the field
  of plant PTMs. We discuss protein modifications including citrullination, glycosylation,
  phosphorylation, oxidation and disulfide bridges, N-terminal, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination.
  Further, we outline the complexity of studying PTMs in relation to compartmentalization
  and function. We conclude by challenging the proteomics community to engage in holistic
  approaches towards identification and characterizing multiple PTMs on the same protein,
  their interaction, and mechanism of regulation to bring a deeper understanding of
  protein function and regulation in plants.
