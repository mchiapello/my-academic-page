abstract: A precise sequence of axon guidance events is required for the development
  of the ocular motor system. Three cranial nerves grow toward, and connect with,
  six extraocular muscles in a stereotyped pattern, to control eye movements. The
  signaling protein alpha2-chimaerin (alpha 2-CHN) plays a pivotal role in the formation
  of the ocular motor system; mutations in CHN1, encoding alpha 2-CHN, cause the human
  eye movement disorder Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS). Our research has demonstrated
  that the manipulation of alpha 2-chn signaling in the zebrafish embryo leads to
  ocular motor axon wiring defects, although the signaling cascades regulated by alpha
  2-chn remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that several cytoskeletal regulatory
  proteins-collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2; encoded by the gene dpysl2),
  stathmin1, and stathmin 2-bind to alpha 2-CHN. dpysl2, stathmin1, and especially
  stathmin2 are expressed by ocular motor neurons. We find that the manipulation of
  dpysl2 and of stathmins in zebrafish larvae leads to defects in both the axon wiring
  of the ocular motor system and the optokinetic reflex, impairing horizontal eye
  movements. Knockdowns of these molecules in zebrafish larvae of either sex caused
  axon guidance phenotypes that included defasciculation and ectopic branching; in
  some cases, these phenotypes were reminiscent of DRS. chn1 knock-down phenotypes
  were rescued by the overexpression of CRMP2 and STMN1, suggesting that these proteins
  act in the same signaling pathway. These findings suggest that CRMP2 and stathmins
  signal downstream of alpha 2-CHN to orchestrate ocular motor axon guidance and to
  control eye movements.
