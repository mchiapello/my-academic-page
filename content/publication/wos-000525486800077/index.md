abstract: '(1) Background: The leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus is the primary vector
  of Flavescence doree phytoplasma (FDp) in European vineyards. Flavescence doree
  is one of the most severely damaging diseases of Vitis vinifera and, consequently,
  a major threat to grape and wine production in several European countries. Control
  measures are compulsory, but they mainly involve large-scale insecticide treatments,
  with detrimental impacts on the environment. One possible solution is to exploit
  the largely unexplored genetic diversity of viruses infecting S. titanus as highly
  specific and environmentally benign tools for biological control. (2) Methods: A
  metatranscriptomic approach was adopted to identify viruses that may infect individuals
  caught in the wild in both its native (United States) and invasive (Europe) areas.
  Reverse transcription PCR was used to confirm their presence in RNA pools and explore
  their prevalence. (3) Results: We described nine new RNA viruses, including members
  of ``Picorna-Calici″, ``Permutotetra″, ``Bunya-Arena″, ``Reo″, ``Partiti-Picobirna″,
  ``Luteo-Sobemo″ and ``Toti-Chryso″ clades. A marked difference in the diversity
  and abundance of the viral species was observed between the USA population and the
  European ones. (4) Conclusions: This work represents the first survey to assess
  the viral community of a phytoplasma insect vector. The possibility to exploit these
  naturally occurring viruses as specific and targeted biocontrol agents of S. titanus
  could be the answer to increasing demand for a more sustainable viticulture.'
