abstract: LmrA is a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug exporter that uses
  metabolic energy to transport ions, cytotoxic drugs, and lipids. Voltage clamping
  in a Port-a-Patch was used to monitor electrical currents associated with the transport
  of monovalent cationic HEPES(+) by single-LmrA transporters and ensembles of transporters.
  In these experiments, one proton and one chloride ion  are effluxed together with
  each HEPES(+) ion out of the inner compartment, whereas two sodium ions are transported
  into this compartment. Consequently, the  sodium-motive force (interior negative
  and low) can drive this electrogenic ion exchange mechanism in cells under physiological
  conditions. The same mechanism is also relevant for the efflux of monovalent cationic
  ethidium, a typical multidrug transporter substrate. Studies in the presence of
  Mg-ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) show that ion-coupled HEPES(+) transport is associated
  with
