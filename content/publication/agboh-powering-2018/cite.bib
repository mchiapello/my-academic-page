 abstract = {LmrA is a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug exporter that uses metabolic energy to transport ions, cytotoxic drugs, and lipids. Voltage clamping in a Port-a-Patch was used to monitor electrical currents associated with the transport of monovalent cationic HEPES(+) by single-LmrA transporters and ensembles of transporters. In these experiments, one proton and one chloride ion  are effluxed together with each HEPES(+) ion out of the inner compartment, whereas two sodium ions are transported into this compartment. Consequently, the  sodium-motive force (interior negative and low) can drive this electrogenic ion exchange mechanism in cells under physiological conditions. The same mechanism is also relevant for the efflux of monovalent cationic ethidium, a typical multidrug transporter substrate. Studies in the presence of Mg-ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) show that ion-coupled HEPES(+) transport is associated with},
