abstract: 'Holothuria polii is a marine animal with an important ecological and economic
  impact. In the present study we analysed the presence of mycoviruses associated
  to fungi that were isolated from different H. polii tissues. Among the 48 fungal
  isolates analysed we identified 10 viruses in 8 strains belonging to 7 fungal species.
  Five out of nine viruses have a dsRNA genome: three of them belong to the Partitiviridae
  family, one belongs to a still undefined clade of bipartite viruses and the last
  one belongs to the Chrysoviridae family. We also identified two viruses belonging
  to a recently proposed new mycovirus taxon named polymycovirus. Two viruses belong
  to the positive single stranded RNA clade: one falls into the new Botourmiaviridae
  family, specifically in the Magoulivirus genus, and the other one falls into a still
  undefined clade phylogenetically related to tombusviruses. Finally, we also identified
  a virus with a negative stranded RNA genome showing similarity to a group of viruses
  recently proposed as a new family of mycoviruses in the order Bunyavirales. A bioinformatics
  approach comparing two datasets of contigs containing two closely related mycobunyaviruses
  allowed us to identify putative nucleocapsids (Nc) and non-structural (Ns) associated
  proteins. The GenBank/eMBL/DDBJ accession numbers of the sequences reported in this
  paper are: PRJNA432529, MG913290, MG913291, MG887747, MG887748, MG887749, MG887750,
