abstract: Several studies have investigated soil microbial biodiversity, but understanding
  of the mechanisms underlying plant responses to soil microbiota remains in its infancy.
  Here, we focused on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), testing the hypothesis that plants
  grown on native soils display different responses to soil microbiotas. Using transcriptomics,
  proteomics, and biochemistry, we describe the responses of two tomato genotypes
  (susceptible or resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) grown on an
  artificial growth substrate and two native soils (conducive and suppressive to Fusarium).
  Native soils affected tomato responses by modulating pathways involved in responses
  to oxidative stress, phenol biosynthesis, lignin deposition, and innate immunity,
  particularly in the suppressive soil. In tomato plants grown on steam-disinfected
  soils, total phenols and lignin decreased significantly. The inoculation of a mycorrhizal
  fungus partly rescued this response locally and systemically. Plants inoculated
  with the fungal pathogen showed reduced disease symptoms in the resistant genotype
  in both soils, but the susceptible genotype was partially protected from the pathogen
  only when grown on the suppressive soil. The `state of alert' detected in tomatoes
  reveals novel mechanisms operating in plants in native soils and the soil microbiota
  appears to be one of the drivers of these plant responses.
