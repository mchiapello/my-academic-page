I am **currently working as Senior PostDoc** at the Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection (Italian National Research Council). My daily focus is on **bioinformatics analysis** and **method standardization** for plant and fungal virus identification from NGS samples. I am a big **supporter of reproducible and open research**. My main tools are R, git, vim and docker.
I am a **curious person** and a **dedicated worker**, I love the challenges of **computational biology** and teaching the principle of **data analysis and visualization**.
